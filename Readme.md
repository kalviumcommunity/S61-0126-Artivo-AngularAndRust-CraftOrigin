### Problem Statement

Tribal and rural artists often depend on middlemen to sell their artwork. These intermediaries take a large share of the profit, resulting in unfair pricing, loss of authenticity, and lack of global reach for the artists. Buyers also struggle to find genuine, traceable handmade art directly from creators.

### Proposed Solution

We propose a **web-based marketplace** that directly connects **tribal and rural artists with global buyers**, eliminating middlemen. The platform ensures **fair trade**, **authenticity**, and **global visibility** for traditional art.

* **Angular** will be used to build a scalable, modular, and responsive frontend.
* **Rust** will power a high-performance, secure backend with REST APIs.
* **PostgreSQL** will store artist, product, and transaction data reliably.

This solution empowers artists economically while preserving cultural heritage.

#### Checklist

* **Target users:** Tribal & rural artists, global art buyers
* **Pain point:** Exploitation by middlemen, lack of fair pricing & authenticity
* **Why web-based:** Global accessibility, scalability, easy discovery
* **Why Angular + Rust:** Clean frontend–backend separation, performance, security
